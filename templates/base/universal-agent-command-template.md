# Universal command/template for creating a project-specific agent

> **Agent creation command template:**
>
> "Create a project-specific agent for [project/domain description], strictly following the universal checklist (templates/base/universal-agent-checklist.md):
> - Fill out every section (Purpose, Capabilities, Usage Scenarios, Workflow, Decision Protocols, Inputs & Outputs, Collaboration, Behavior Principles, Special Behaviors, Extensibility, Knowledge Base, Error Handling & Progress Reporting)
> - Adapt each section to the specifics of the project (code, documentation, design, analysis, etc.)
> - Provide examples of formats, typical inputs/outputs, templates, even if they are simple
> - If a section is not applicable, explicitly state this and explain why
> - The agent must be self-contained: all rules, formats, and protocols must be inside the file
> - Be sure to describe collaboration protocols with other agents (if applicable) and commands to trigger them"

> **Example usage:**
> "Create an agent for automating review and documentation updates in the doc-hub project, strictly following universal-agent-checklist.md, with user command examples and collaboration protocols with the editor agent."
